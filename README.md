Neupane, D., Osborne, S. L., Roeder, K. A., Knoll, A. E., and Ewing, P. M. 2025. Feed grain polycultures mitigate weather risk, support arthropods, and suppress weeds in the Western Corn Belt. *Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment*. [Link](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2025.109773).

Data was collected at the Eastern South Dakota Soil and Water Research Farm in Brookings, South Dakota, USA in 2023. Treatments were:

- oat monoculture
- pea monoculture
- oat-pea intercrop
- oat-pea-flax intercrop

Treatments were planted at two dates to simulate different weather years and assessed for:

- yield (total)
- yield (land-equivalent basis)
- grain quality for feed
- arthropod activity
- weed suppression
